# Buzz Bombers (C++ with SFML)

## 🎮 Overview
This is a recreation of the classic 1982 arcade game *Buzz Bombers*, developed using **C++** and **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**. The player controls a can of bug spray to ward off swarms of bees while managing obstacles and game mechanics.

## 🛠 Features
- **Player-controlled spray can** to shoot at bees.
- **Randomly spawning enemies** with distinct movement patterns.
- **Collision detection** between projectiles, bees, and obstacles.
- **Simple HUD** displaying score and game status.
